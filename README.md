# CTC-Based-Automated-Speech-Recognition

I implemented an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model utilizing the Conformer architecture, streamlining the speech recognition process. The model was trained on the mini Librispeech ASR corpus using SpeechBrain, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 39.91% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 79.02%. To improve the model's performance, I enhanced the temporal modeling by integrating inter-CTC loss from intermediate encoder layers, which contributed to better convergence during training.
